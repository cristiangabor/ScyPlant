# ScyPlant
<b> The Program </b>

	ScyPlant is a database program which amis to store important info
about plants and their pictures. This start up version is the very first step on my 
idea to store info's about plant. I intend to continue the next vresion by adding a image 
processing algorithm that will scan the picture the user provides it and the program 
will return useful info about the plant in the picture. 

<b> Installing and runing the program </b>

	Unitl now there is only one way to use the program:
	
	- Executing the Python source file

<b> Python source files </b>

	To run the program using the source files you will need to have the following installed:

	- Python 2.7
	- PyQt 4.9.6
	- SQLite plugin

	The program it wil work with higer version of Python and PyQt but you will have to modify 
the databaseplante.py to suit the next versions of python. 

Soon I intend to make an executable for windows so stay tuned.
